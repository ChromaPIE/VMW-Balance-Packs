# VMW-Balance-Packs
Hey everyone!
I will be writing this very, very basic "explanation" about how to use the VMW BalancePacks because I see a lot of people asking about it.
Before I get into it, I will warn you that the Balance Packs (as of the first released alpha) have very limited functionality.


You will not be able to use anything other than:
  - `enabled`: whether or not the gun should be enabled.
  - `recoil`: the gun's recoil.
  - `damage`: how much damage the gun deals.
 
Things such as `FireRate`, `GravityVelocity`, `PelletsPerShot`, `MaxShots`, etc. are still only available by using PWEM with VMW 2.0.
I will not be updating PWEM to version 3.0 as of right now, so please, don't ask me about it!


**So, how do I get started?**

You first want to ensure that you have the example template generated. To do that, start your game, go into single-player and run the command "/balancepack". What this will do is generate a file in the directory "%appdata%/.minecraft/balancepacks/default_pack.json".

What is this file? The "default_pack.json" file is your 'example', or 'template' balancepack file.
Go ahead and have a read over it! You should start to understand how this works.
